"Kahoot like karaoke" 
a fun little porject i'm working on, based on node js.
a karaoke system that operates like a Kahoot game. 
Instead of using expansive dedicated equipment, the microphone will be your own phone, and the karaoke screen your computer or smart tv.

node js packeges in use:
express
googleapis
socket.io
peer
